What is OAuth2PasswordRequestForm?
It is a built-in class from fastapi.security that expects data submitted using the 
application/x-www-form-urlencoded format (like regular HTML forms or Postman form fields).

It expects two form fields:

username

password

These are automatically extracted and validated when a user submits the login form.
